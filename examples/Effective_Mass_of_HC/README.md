# Effective Mass of HC
This folder contains a simple example using EffectiveMass v2.0.2 to calculate the effective mass of HC. Document "HC Effective Mass.out" in folder "HC CASTEP Energy" (or "HC DMol3 Energy") is the calculation result generated by EffectiveMass v2.0.2.

All files in this example folder, except documents "HC Effective Mass.out" in folders "HC CASTEP Energy" and "HC DMol3 Energy", are generated by CASTEP and DMol3 programs in Materials Studio automatically. These files are uploaded to Github just for demonstrate, not for academic, commercial or other usages, and should not be used otherwhere.
